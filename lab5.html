        <h3>1. JQuery questions:</h3>

        <h5>What you can do with the jQuery? </h5>
        <p>Well, jQuery is a JS library that is meant to make client-side scripting into a more pleasant experience. It follows the principle "do more, write less", making code-heavy tasks less bulky. Taking into account how popular it is, you can do pretty much anything with it. </p>

        <h5>How it can help you as web developer? </h5>
        <p>It simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX calls, which are pretty complicated on their own. However, it can do a lot more then that. Too much to cover, in fact. </p>

        <h5>If you think our earlier participant list app, in what kind of issues you could use jQuery? </h5>
        <p>Well, you can add some cool features to it, like editing the list on the go.</p>

        <h5>What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them? </h5>
        <p>CDN is short for Content Delivery Network and can also somethimes be referred to as mirroring. CDN is a system of servers aimed at delivering web content to the user based on the geographical location. When user is trying to access the service, CDN server redirects the request to the nearest CDN server to the user.</p>

        <h4>Some thoughts on this lab:</h4>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>What can I say, jQuery miracle just fills me up with glee.</li>
          <li>This week was very relaxing.</li>
          <li>AJAX was few google searches away, though everything kind of is. I didn't see the table thing coming, kudos to Joel for finding it out. I was going to go with a simple wall of text as everyone else.
            <br> (that's what you wanted us to do though, I hope it's fine to deviate a little)</li>
          <li>Btw, it is kind of weird to follow the instructions that you know would result with an error. It's always there! </li>
          <li>I'm getting a feeling that I'm making everything sound easy and mundane or whatever. The tasks are fairly challenging and take quite a while to figure out though.</li>
